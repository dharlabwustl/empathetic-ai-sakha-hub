    <h2>Newton's Second Law of Motion</h2>
    <p>Newton's Second Law states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.</p>
    <p>It can be mathematically expressed as:</p>
    <p class="text-center font-bold text-xl my-4">F = ma</p>
    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 my-4">
      <li><strong>F</strong> is the net force applied (measured in newtons, N)</li>
      <li><strong>m</strong> is the mass of the object (measured in kilograms, kg)</li>
      <li><strong>a</strong> is the acceleration (measured in meters per second squared, m/sÂ²)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This fundamental law forms the backbone of classical mechanics and helps us analyze and predict the motion of objects under the influence of forces.</p>
